          <h3>Another big win in Kings County, Supreme Court</h3>
          <p class="fs_xl">
            This was round two in a battle between our client, a wonderful,
            well-known, and respected international travel company, and another
            travel company over purported claims of unfair competition under New
            York and California law. We obtained dismissal of the case once in
            August 2022, but the plaintiff was allowed to amend some of its
            claims. This time, Judge Valerie Caproni granted our motion and
            dismissed the amended complaint, with prejudice, and later awarded
            us costs and attorneysâ€™ fees.
